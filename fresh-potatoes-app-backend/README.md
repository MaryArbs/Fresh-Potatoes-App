# Fresh Potatoes App
This is a fully functional Single Page Application (SPA). The frontend was build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The frontend communicates with a backend API that's built using Ruby and Rails.

# Overview
Fresh Potatoes is an app to track and review the movies that we love.

# Installation
Fork and clone repo

$ git clone git@github.com:MaryArbs/Fresh-Potatoes-App.git

Switch to directory

$ cd fresh-potatoes-app

Split the terminal - in one terminal, switch to the frontend (cd frontend) and in the other terminal, switch to the backend (cd backend)

$ cd frontend
$ cd backend

Startup the server (within the backend terminal)

$ rails s

Enter in browser to launch the rails server

$  localhost:3000

Open index.html (within the frontend terminal)

$ open index.html

# Usage 

Enter the title of the movie you would like to add into the form. To add an image link, go to the IMDB website, search for the movie you would like to add. Once you are on the movie IMDB page, open the dev tools(ctr, shift, j) and copy the image element. Paste the image link onto the form in the Fresh Potatoes App (do not include the quotation marks around the image link). Once your movie is added, you can add a review for your movie, and/or review a movie that is already on the list. Enjoy!
